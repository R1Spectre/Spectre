# Spectre
**The packaged build of Spectre**

This mostly works and includes support for loading mods in a similar format to [R2Northstar](https://github.com/R2Northstar)

Features:
- Mod loading
  - Custom scripting
  - Asset replacement
- Source console (with support for running squirrel functions, thanks p0358)
- Working SQVM hooks
- Custom convar & concommand support
- Probably more stuff I forgot about

Missing things that I would hope can be added:
- Ability to enable/disable mods in game
- Dedicated server support (can't be done with *legally* getting an r1 server.dll)
- Security patches

Thanks to [p0358](https://github.com/p0358) ([Black Market Edition](https://github.com/p0358/black_market_edition) and [TFORevive](https://github.com/TFORevive)) and [BobTheBob](https://github.com/BobTheBob9) ([R2Northstar](https://github.com/R2Northstar)) for having code I could refer too and reuse.

(Check those out, having contributed to Northstar and TFORevive I can say they're both quite bitching. - barnabwhy)
